## Overview

The Economic Alignment Workshop brings together researchers at the intersection of microeconomics and AI alignment. We aim to foster collaboration between scholars working in social choice theory, personalization, industrial organization, and those focused on AI post-training and evaluation methodologies.

As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, the need for rigorous theoretical frameworks to ensure their alignment with human values and societal objectives has never been more critical. This workshop creates a dedicated space for economists and AI researchers to exchange ideas, methodologies, and insights that bridge these complementary fields.

## Key Themes

**Social Choice & Collective Decision-Making**
How can voting theory, preference aggregation, and mechanism design inform AI alignment strategies? What frameworks help AI systems navigate conflicting stakeholder preferences?

**Personalization & Heterogeneous Preferences**
How should AI systems adapt to individual user preferences What are fundamental trade-offs?

**Industrial Organization & Market Design**
How do competitive dynamics between AI systems affect alignment incentives? How does alignment and consumer steering interact?

**Post-Training & Evaluation Frameworks**
How can economic principles guide RLHF, preference learning, and evaluation?
